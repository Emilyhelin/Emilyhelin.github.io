        "abstract": "The human being throughout history has developed ways to optimize his time and resources. Nowadays, mobility is one of the biggest problems. Traffic simulation tools are frequently used to study mobility problems. GeoSparkSim is a vehicular traffic simulation tool that extends Apache Spark to generate datasets of road network traffic significantly with the simulation of microscopic traffic that includes traffic lights, change of track, and the pursuit of vehicles. This work presents an architecture to implement and evaluate the GeoSparkSim simulation tool. The architecture was developed on different containers in Docker, and two stages of the study were created for its evaluation. Each stage contains 26 simulations in different geographic zones from the Quito city. Results show the potentials of GeoSparkSim in order to study traffic mobility and compare its implementation on different Cloud services such as Google, Amazon, and Azure. In order to have an acceptable simulation, we found a machine that has at least 146\u00a0GB in storage and 8\u00a0GB in RAM is recommended.",

        "abstract": "Researchers and practitioners have widely studied road network traffic data in different areas such as urban planning, traffic prediction and spatial-temporal databases. For instance, researchers use such data to evaluate the impact of road network changes. Unfortunately, collecting large-scale high-quality urban traffic data requires tremendous efforts because participating vehicles must install global positioning system(GPS) receivers and administrators must continuously monitor these devices. There have been some urban traffic simulators trying to generate such data with different features. However, they suffer from two critical issues (1) Scalability: most of them only offer single-machine solution which is not adequate to produce large-scale data. Some simulators can generate traffic in parallel but do not well balance the load among machines in a cluster. (2) Granularity: many simulators do not consider microscopic traffic situations including traffic lights, lane changing, car following. This paper proposed GeoSparkSim, a scalable traffic simulator which extends Apache Spark to generate large-scale road network traffic datasets with microscopic traffic simulation. The proposed system seamlessly integrates with a Spark-based spatial data management system, GeoSpark, to deliver a holistic approach that allows data scientists to simulate, analyze and visualize large-scale urban traffic data. To implement microscopic traffic models, GeoSparkSim employs a simulation-aware vehicle partitioning method to partition vehicles among different machines such that each machine has a balanced workload. The experimental analysis shows that GeoSparkSim can simulate the movements of 300 thousand vehicles over a very large road network (250 thousand road junctions and 300 thousand road segments) and outperform the existing competitors.",

        "abstract": "Bibiographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.",

Several key challenges are solved: dividing a large traffic network, routing vehicles traveling across tiles, trans\u0002ferring vehicles across tiles, and globally synchronizing the simulation time to achieve a complete solution to automate scalable concurrent simulations. These solutions are automated in ParamGrid.

        "abstract": "Simulation modeling is an increasingly popular and effective tool for analyzing transportation problems, which are not amendable to study by other means. We examine the need for parallel or distributed simulation approaches from the need for computational speed-ups, availability of options towards that, and then at the need to distribute the effort to develop network simulation contexts and datasets. After an overview of the general techniques for the distributed discrete-event simulation and previous efforts on the distributed traffic simulation, we present the general architecture of the proposed distributed modeling framework. Two categories of modeling strategies, namely, light global control / independent subnets vs. heavy global control / coordinated subnets are described. We have implemented the distributed scheme of light global control / independent subnets and the implemented details, such as communication techniques and vehicle transferring across the boundary of two subnets are discussed. Unlike the previous studies using the dedicated high performance machines, our efforts are to utilize the low-cost networked PCs that are commonly available. By using the API supported by off-the-shelf Paramics software, we are able to distribute the computational load of microscopic simulation to multiple single-processor PCs without access the proprietary source codes of the simulation program. Performance testing and analysis of the implemented prototype demonstrate that the proposed framework is very promising",

        "abstract": "This paper describes the parallel implementation of the TRANSIMS traffic micro-simulation. The parallelization method is domain decomposition, which means that each CPU of the parallel computer is responsible for a different geographical area of the simulated region. We describe how information between domains is exchanged, and how the transportation network graph is partitioned. An adaptive scheme is used to optimize load balancing. We then demonstrate how computing speeds of our parallel micro-simulations can be systematically predicted once the scenario and the computer architecture are known. This makes it possible, for example, to decide if a certain study is feasible with a certain computing budget, and how to invest that budget. The main ingredients of the prediction are knowledge about the parallel implementation of the micro-simulation, knowledge about the characteristics of the partitioning of the transportation network graph, and knowledge about the interaction of these quantities with the computer system. In particular, we investigate the differences between switched and non-switched topologies, and the effects of 10 Mbit, 100 Mbit, and Gbit Ethernet. As one example, we show that with a common technology \u2013 100 Mbit switched Ethernet \u2013 one can run the 20 000-link EMME/2-network for Portland (Oregon) more than 20 times faster than real time on 16 coupled Pentium CPUs.",

        "abstract": "Benchmarking spatiotemporal database systems or their components requires the definition of suitable datasets simulating the typical behavior of moving objects. Previous approaches do not consider one important property of moving objects: In many applications they follow a given network. Therefore, benchmarks require datasets consisting of such \u201cnetwork-based\u201d moving objects. In this paper, the most important properties of network-based moving objects are presented and discussed. Important aspects are the maximum speed and the maximum capacity of connections, the influence of other moving objects on the speed and the route of an object, the adequate determination of the start and destination of an object, the influence of external impacts and events, and time-scheduled traffic. The results of the discussion are the basis for a specification and development of a new generator for spatiotemporal data. This generator combines real data (the network) with user-defined properties of the resulting dataset. A framework is proposed where the user can control the behavior of the generator by re-defining the functionality of selected object classes. An experimental performance investigation demonstrates that the chosen approach is suitable for generating large data sets. Finally, the requirements for promoting the generator and an evolutionary definition of benchmark data are discussed. ,",
